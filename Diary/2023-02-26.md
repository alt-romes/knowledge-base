Re-thinking checking plug-in compatibility when loading as discussed in https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/20742:

* When ghc is built with cabal, cabal passes a flag -this-unit-id with the name (ghc), version, and hash of the unit, however, the ghc-options specify a -this-unit-id that overwrites the cabal passed one with simply  "ghc".
* The interface of compiled modules that depend on ghc simply have the unit i'd `ghc` as a dependency, despite showing `ghc-version` (this is because when pretty printing interface files we have special logic to find the version (by looking in the package db?))
* When we load a plug-in we can't identify which version of ghc the plugin was compiled with.
* We link the plugin against the ghc library (associated with?--linked to) the compiler loading the plugin (why this one) -- regardless of whether that ghc library was the one that the plugin was originally compiled against.
* If we stop overriding the flag, the flag as it is passed by cabal will be used as the unit id. However, to not override the flag we need the wired in things to know the unit-id passed (otherwise we can't have wired-in things).
* This way, loading a plugin we can identify the ghc version that compiled it (because the interface file contains ghc's unit-id which now identifies the ghc version and more (the hash))
* GHC as built by hadrian must also be given a unit-id with a hash, so hadrian will need to learn about how hashes are computed by cabal (see note [[Cabal unit-id creation]])
* Finally, at load time, ghc must know the unit id of its (associated?--linked to) ghc library so that it can be compared against the unit-id of the plugin's ghc dependency
