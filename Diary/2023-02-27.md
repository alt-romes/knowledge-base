Despite the hash computation described in [[Cabal unit-id creation]], we don't need to uniquely identify the ghc package compiled against the plugin and the one linked against the ghc binary. We simply need those packages to be [[ABI compatible packages]], which depends solely on the abi hash of its exposed modules (computed by ghc with `--abi-hash Exposed1.hs Exposed2.hs ...`).

For a first iteration of loading compatible packages, hadrian's generated hash can simply be the ABI hash directly (truncated depending on platform). Eventually, we might want to give a more proper unit-id that considers things like compilation flags.

Next steps:
* How can GHC know the unit-id of the ghc package it is linked against
* How can we remove -this-unit-id ghc such that the one passed by cabal is the one effectively used? See [[Note {Wired-in units}]].

The GHC branch `wip/romes/fix-docs` serves to push fixes to the documentation
